Get in lab,rp_start,ObjectiveType.ReachPosition,tp_test,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,IS THE CAMERA WORKING FINE? YOU SHOULD CHECK ON IT. PICK IT UP AND TRY TAKING A SHOT.
Test take photo,tp_test,ObjectiveType.TakePhoto,so_test,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,OKAY. I WILL ASSUME THAT YOUR CAMERA IS FINE. EVEN IT IS NO DIFFERENT FROM SCRAP. NOW TAKE OUT YOUR SCANNER AND TRY SCAN ON RECEPTION TABLE. THIS SHIT WON'T ACTIVE IF YOU DON'T HOLD THE LEFT CLICK UNTIL COMPLETE.
Test scan object,so_test,ObjectiveType.ScanObject,tp_suit,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,I JUST OPENED THE DOOR FOR YOU. FIRST YOU NEED TO TAKE THE PHOTO OF A HELMET. A SCIETIST'S HELMET. FIND THE PREP ROOM. THIS SHOUL BE EASY.
Take photo of Science suit,tp_suit,ObjectiveType.TakePhoto,rp_con,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,LOOKS EXPENSIVE EH? THE COLLECTOR TEAM WILL COME PICK IT UP LATER. FIND THE CONTROL ROOM TO OPEN THE DOORS.
Open Control Room,rp_con,ObjectiveType.ReachPosition,so_tool_sci,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,"I CAN SEE CONTROL ROOM'S GREEN LIGHT ON THE MAP. OKAY, PROCEED TO THE STORAGE ROOM AND SCAN A SCIENCTIFIC TOOL FOR ME."
Scan Scientific tool,so_tool_sci,ObjectiveType.ScanObject,tp_shelfroom,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,WAIT. THIS IS BIOLOGICAL TOOL. ARE THEY RESEARCHING THE BIO-TECH HERE? ON THE MOON? I'M SURE THERE'S MORE NEARBY ON THE SHELF. GO FIND IT.
Take photo in Shelf Room,tp_shelfroom,ObjectiveType.TakePhoto,so_tool_shelf,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,I HAVE NO IDEA JUST SEEING IT. YOU NEED TO SCAN THE ENTIRE SHELF. SO I CAN RUN MORE ANALYTICAL DATA.
Scan Shelf science,so_tool_shelf,ObjectiveType.ScanObject,rp_lab,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,OKAY. I THINK WE FOUND SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING. THE SHELF IS FULL OF DISSECTION TOOLS. GET TO THE LAB ZONE THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF GOOD STUFFS THERE. BUT YOU NEED TO ACTIVE THE POWER BUTTON IN CONTROL ROOM.
Check Laboratory zone,rp_lab,ObjectiveType.ReachPosition,tp_laboratory_1,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,WHAT'S WRONG? I WON'T ACTIVE THE ELEVATOR FOR YOU UNTIL YOU COMPLETE THE DAMN JOB. TAKE ALL THREE LAB TOOL PHOTO IN THE LAB AREA. LOOK FOR THE ORANGE TRIANGLE MARK.
Take photo Laboratory zone 1/3,tp_laboratory_1,ObjectiveType.TakePhoto,tp_laboratory_2,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,TWO LEFT.
Take photo Laboratory zone 2/3,tp_laboratory_2,ObjectiveType.TakePhoto,tp_laboratory_3,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,ONE LEFT.
Take photo Laboratory zone 3/3,tp_laboratory_3,ObjectiveType.TakePhoto,so_lab_sci,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,OKAY. I NEED MORE SCAN DATA FOR OUR COLLECTOR. SCAN ANYTHING YOU THINK IT IS INTERESTING. SOMETHING LIKE THE LAB BENCH.
Scan Lab bench,so_lab_sci,ObjectiveType.ScanObject,so_cham_sci,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,A SURGERY BENCH WITH BLOOD ON IT? GOOD. I NEED MORE. SCAN ONE OR TWO THING. I THINK IF YOU SEARCH TO THE NORTH AREA YOU MIGHT FOUND SOMETHING.
Scan Growth chamber,so_cham_sci,ObjectiveType.ScanObject,so_ex_sci,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,WHAT THE HELL. THEY ARE RUNNING XENO RESEARCH ON THE MOON. THE RUMOR WAS TRUE. I NEED TO KNOW MORE. THE EXPERIMENT CAPSULE SHOULD BE NEARBY. SCAN IT AND GET OUT OF THERE.
Scan Experimental bed,so_ex_sci,ObjectiveType.ScanObject,rp_base,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,ECHO3 YOU NEED TO GET BACK TO THE ELEAVATOR. NOW.
Get back to base,rp_base,ObjectiveType.ReachPosition,,DELTA2,0EFF00,FFFFFF,FF2000,

	[CHANGE] Made prefabs containing scripts from Curvy Splines openable in Play Mode
	[CHANGE] Position gizmo for Bezier handles is now slightly different than Unity's position gizmo
		This is to make it easier to distinguish the position gizmo of a Control Point from its handles'
	[CHANGE] Volume Spots module: the minimal allowed depth for objects was changed from 0.01 to 0.001
		This is to allow for placement of smaller objects
	[OPTIM] Reduced various initialization times, as well as entering Play Mode and reload times
		This is especially visible in projects with a big number of scripts
	[FIXED] Building for iOS platform leads to errors
	[FIXED] Under Unity 2022.1 beta, an error message is sometimes displayed at project reloading 
	
8.0.2
	[OPTIM] Minor optimization of the Deform Mesh module
	[FIXED] Control point's gizmo labels are not positioned properly under certain Unity versions
		This bug is due to a regression in Unity that has been fixed lately. Curvy had a workaround to that regression. This update disables the workaround for the latest Unity versions that don't need the workaround. It is recommended to use both Curvy 8.0.2 or higher, and Unity 2021.2.12f1 or higher
		More about the issue here: https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/handles-dot-label-does-not-appear-in-the-supposed-place

8.0.0
	TL;DR Deform Mesh and other new CG modules, Spline Controller's On Position Reached events, SVG import, B-Splines, Spline To Edge Collider 2D, major optimizations, a LOT of fixes and an easier workflow

	General
		[NEW] Added a Curvy Spline To Edge Collider 2D script
		[NEW] Added an Array Pools Settings script
			Curvy Splines now use pools of arrays as a mean to reduce CPU time. These pools have a default capacity. Automatically, an instance of Array Pools Settings is added to the _CurvyGlobal_ object. It allows you to define the capacity of the pools, and shows you their current usage. Set the Capacity to 0 to not use the pools at all
		[CHANGE] Changed the folders structure. Now everything is in a Plugins/ToolBuddy folder. As recommended for every update, please delete the old Curvy folders before installing the new version
		[CHANGE] Improved various UIs, including the Curvy Generator: improved ease of use, added tooltips, added warning messages when relevant, etc..
		[CHANGE] Various documentation enhancements
		[OPTIM] Optimized various features, both in edit mode and play mode. The optimizations are related to both CPU time and memory usage. The biggest of these optimizations greatly improves scenarios involving frequent updates of Curvy Generator, such as real-time mesh generation
		[FIXED] Toolbar not displaying when setting the Unity Editor language to a language other than English
		[FIXED] Truncated text in some buttons due to new UI
		[API/CHANGE] SerializableArray has changed namespace from FluffyUnderware.CurvyEditor to FluffyUnderware.Curvy.Utils

			[API/NEW] Added CurvySpline.GetNearestPoint
			[API/NEW] Added CurvyUtility.SplineToMesh
			[API/NEW] Added CurvyUtility.GetNearestPointIndex
			[API/NEW] CurvySpline.Clear has now an optional parameter to define if the spline clearing should be undoable in the editor or not
			[API/NEW] Added new methods to get the spline's cached data. Those methods use pooled arrays: GetPositionsCache, GetTangentsCache and GetNormalsCache
			[API/CHANGE] Start and OnEnable now invoke the OnRefresh event always if the spline has Control Points, and never if the spline is empty
			[API/CHANGE] Refresh now invokes the OnRefresh event only if there were actual modifications processed by the Refresh method
		Scene view UI
			[NEW] Added an Orientation Anchors gizmo
			[NEW] Added a Relative Distances gizmo
			[NEW] Added a TF gizmo
			[NEW] Draw Splines tool: Added a new drawing plane, the view plane
			[NEW] Draw Splines tool: CTRL+clicking on the first Control Point of a spline closes it/opens it
			[CHANGE] Connection gizmos are now a separate setting from the Curve gizmo. They can now be activated separately
			[CHANGE] Control Points' Label gizmos are now displayed even when the CP is not selected

			[FIXED] Rectangle's normals are incorrect when increasing the cache density
			[FIXED] Shapes not having the proper normals when setting planes other than the default one

	Curvy Generator
		General
			[NEW] New module: Deform Mesh. Deforms a given mesh along a path
			[NEW] New module: Input Transform Spots. Sets a spot that is tied with a Game Object's transform
			[NEW] New module: GameObject To Mesh. Converts GameObjects to Volume Meshes
			[NEW] Create GameObject module: Added a new setting: "Apply Layer On Children"
			[CHANGE] Create Mesh module: a 32 bit index format is now used if the mesh has too many vertices, allowing to create meshes with more than 65535 vertices
			[CHANGE] Create Mesh module: The default mesh collider's cooking options now includes Use Fast Midphase for the relevant Unity versions
			[CHANGE] Create Mesh module: The AddNormals and AddTangents enums are replaced with boolean parameters
			[CHANGE] Volume Mesh module: Removed Material ID from the UI since it was not used. The used material id is the material group's index (displayed as the tab's title)
			[CHANGE] Input Spline Shape module: created shapes no more have their gizmos hidden by default
			[CHANGE] Curvy Generators' instances now have incremental names
			[CHANGE] Shape Extrusion Module: the following settings are not available anymore, and are assumed to be always true: Hard Edges, Materials and Extended UV
				The reason behind this change is to lift the legitimate confusion some users had: until now, to use one of those settings in a shape extrusion, you had to both activate the setting in the module and activate the equivalent setting in the "Meta CG Options" meta data of the relevant Control Point. Now you only need to activate the setting in the meta data
			[OPTIM] Create Mesh module: When creating multiple meshes with mesh colliders, the colliders are baked in parallel
				Warning: as a limitation from Unity, the parallel baking will be ignored if you set the cooking options to any value different than the default value. For more details: https://forum.unity.com/threads/physics-bakemesh-question.741257/#post-4999400
			[FIXED] The Auto Refresh feature stops working properly if you switch scenes without destroying the Curvy Generator
			[FIXED] CG's ordering of its modules in the hierarchy sometimes is not consistent

			[FIXED] Create Mesh module: An exception is thrown when inputting a spot with an invalid index (referencing a non existing VMesh input)
			[FIXED] Create Mesh module: when combining two meshes, one with tangent and one without, the Add Tangents parameter is ignored
			[FIXED] Create Mesh module: when AddNormals and AddTangents are set to No, the normals and tangents are still included in mesh, and have invalid values
			[FIXED] Create GameObject and Create Mesh modules: Resources counter and selector sometimes do not work properly
			[FIXED] Volume Spots modules created via API can under some circumstances get their value reset
			[FIXED] Volume Mesh module: Material settings are not undoable
			[FIXED] In Play Mode, deleting the input splines of the Input Spline modules, if done through the module's UI, lead to incomplete deletion of said splines
			[FIXED] Input Spline modules: Sometimes an error is logged when rasterizing a spline too densely
			[FIXED] Input Spots module: trying to add an input after deleting all existing ones generates errors
			[FIXED] Input Spots module: Errors when dragging a Game Object over the module
			[Fixed] Input Game Objects: when an entry has no game object assigned, the module outputs a null game object instead of just ignoring it
			[FIXED] Rasterize Path module: The Range and Length parameters behave as if an open spline is closed, and vice versa
				To restore the previous behaviour if your project depends on it, set the Use Bugged Range setting to true
			[FIXED] Shape Extrusion module sometimes extrudes a faulty mesh when it uses a different range than 0-1 and the associated Input Spline module uses a Start CP different than the first CP
			[FIXED] Shape Extrusion module: When path range loops, and when using the Optimized setting, Advanced Scaling does not work on the path part that is beyond the looping point
			[FIXED] Input Mesh module showing a mesh as having a UV2 channel when it hasn't
			[FIXED] Variable Mix Shapes module sometimes not updating when the associated path changes slightly
			[FIXED] TRS Path module: If applied on a closed path, any extruded mesh using said path is not aligned at its looping point
			[FIXED] Editor lags when refreshing a generator in projects that have a lot of assets
			[FIXED] Dropping a spline in the generator window sometimes does not create an input module
			[API/NEW] Added CGVolume.Scales
			[API/NEW] CGVMesh.GetSortedVertexIndices
			[API/CHANGE] CGVMesh.ToMesh now has two optional parameters defining whether the normals and tangents should be copied or not
			[API/CHANGE] Made mandatory the previously optional includeOnRequestProcessing parameter of the CurvyGenerator.GetModules methods. It being optional and having a default value set to false made it confusing for its users
			[API/CHANGE] The BuildRasterizedPath.From setter now handles the edge value of 1 similarly to BuildShapeExtrusion.From
			[API/FIXED] The following methods ignore the modules that implement the IOnRequestProcessing interface: CurvyGenerator.GetModuleOutputSlot(int, string) and CurvyGenerator.GetModuleOutputSlot(string, string)
			[API/FIXED] Conform Path and Path Relative Translation modules: the output path's Length and F are not updated
			[API/FIXED] The CGSpots(CGSpots source) constructor does not copy the source spots, but copies just the reference
			[API/FIXED] Pushing then popping an instance of CGMeshResource in the same frame can lead to some of its components to be deleted
		Exporting Game Objects/Meshes
			[NEW] Added a Save Output To Scene button in the toolbar. This will copy to outside the generator all the generated meshes and game objects
			[NEW] Added a Clear Outputs button in the toolbar. This will delete all the generated meshes and game objects in a single click
			[NEW] Create GameObject module: Added a Save To Scene button
			[CHANGE] Create GameObject and Create Mesh modules: Now exported game objects are always under a parent game object, even if there is only one exported game object
			[CHANGE] Create GameObject and Create Mesh modules: When multiple objects are exported, their parent GameObject is now named "<module_name> Exported Resources" instead of "<module_name>"
		Prefabs
			[CHANGE] Prefabs: Better handling of forbidden prefab related operations
				Some operations, like deleting a game object, are not allowed in a prefab instance due to Unity's New Prefab System. When Curvy Generator was asked to delete an object part of a prefab instance, it showed an error message in the console. Now, it will behave as follows:
					- If the object to delete is automatically generated, like an output mesh, and thus can be regenerated by refreshing the Curvy Generator, any operation that leads to its automatic deletion will also delete it from the prefab asset
					- For the other cases, like deleting a module from a graph window, a popup will ask the user to first delete the associated object from the prefab asset
			[FIXED] Create GameObject module: Errors when using input GameObjects that are prefab assets
			[FIXED] Create GameObject and Create Mesh modules: Objects are sometimes duplicated when exiting play mode if the module is part of a prefab
		Graph View
			[NEW] Support for the following hotkeys for modules manipulation:
				Ctrl+D duplicate selected module
				Ctrl+A select all modules
				Ctrl+C copy selected module
				Ctrl+X cut selected module (module is deleted when pasting the cut module)
				Ctrl+V past module
			[NEW] Support for drag and drop of Game Objects, shapes and meshes in the generator view
			[CHANGE] Dropping a link on a module no more selects and focuses the view on said module
			[CHANGE] Module focus is now on the top of the module instead of its bottom. This makes working with big modules, such as Volume Spots, easier
			[CHANGE] A right click on a module now also selects it
			[CHANGE] Dragging a module now selects it
			[FIXED] CG's graph sometimes scrolls in weird directions when dragging a module
			[FIXED] Couldn't deselect a selected module under some circumstances 
			[FIXED] Couldn't do a rectangle drag under some circumstances
			[FIXED] When clicking on a module's title to drag the module, sometimes a link is dragged instead
			[FIXED] CG's graph keeps scrolling by itself
			[FIXED] CG's graph's preview link keeps being displayed even after the user stopped dragging it
			[FIXED] When a selected module is deleted from outside the generator, the latter keeps highlighting the module's contour as if still existing
			[FIXED] Clicking on an empty space does not deselect the selected link
			[FIXED] When a link is under a module, selecting the module can select the link, and sometimes delinking it
			[FIXED] Scrolling bars glitch when trying to drag the view beyond the graph's borders
			[FIXED] Selecting modules via selection rectangle does not select the module's Game Object
			[FIXED] Finishing canvas dragging while the mouse is on a module selects the module
			[FIXED] When deselecting a module by clicking on an empty spot on the graph, the deselection takes a delay to be applied if the mouse is not moving
			[FIXED] Canvas drag stops when hitting any keyboard key
			[API/FIXED] CanvasState.MouseOverLink is giving wrong results
		UV and UV2
			General
				[NEW] Create Mesh module: When combining multiple Volume Meshes, you now have the option to recompute UV2 for the combined mesh. This can give better results than computing UV2 for each Volume Mesh individually. That option is called Unwrap UV2
				[NEW] Volume Mesh module: Added a new setting, Unscale U, that allows for the U coordinates to be independent from the scaling
				[CHANGE] Create Mesh module: Replaced "Add UV2" with Volume Mesh module's "Generate UV2". Now both UV and UV2 are generated by the Volume Mesh module
				[CHANGE] Volume Mesh module: the Keep Aspect setting now has three possible values: Off, Scale U or Scale V
				[FIXED] Volume Mesh module: UV2 calculation is wrong when using the Split setting
					For backward compatibility reasons, the pre Curvy 8 behaviour is still available through the Split UV2 setting, in the Backward Compatibility section
				[FIXED] Volume Mesh module: UV2 incorrectly computed when UV is swapped or negatively scaled
				[FIXED] Volume Mesh module: Tangents are invalid when UVs are missing, swapped or scaled negatively
				[FIXED] Spline To Mesh window: Wrong UV2 values
				[FIXED] Build Volume Caps module: Wrong UV2 values
				[FIXED] Volume Caps module: The Keep Aspect enum does not work properly
			Meta CG Options
				[CHANGE] Now shows only the settings that are relevant (that will be used in that specific context)
				[CHANGE] "Explicit U" and "Set U from neighbours" are now possible for CPs with a change of Material ID
				[FIXED] When there is a change of Material ID at a specific CP, its "UV Edge" is overridden to true
					For those relaying on that old behaviour, you will have to set "UV Edge" to true for all the CPs with a change of Material ID. You can find a code snippet that does that here: https://forum.curvyeditor.com/thread-1294.html
				[FIXED] On the first CP of an open spline, in some cases First U is ignored when setting Explicit U (second U is used instead)
				[FIXED] On the first CP of an open spline, First U and second U can be displayed even if the CP is not a UV Edge or has Explicit U
				[FIXED] Exception is sometimes thrown when last CP of a spline has an Explicit U value
				[FIXED] ArgumentOutOfRangeException when computing UV under some circumstances
				[FIXED] When setting two points CPs to the same explicit U, the second CP will have an invalid U value under some circumstances
				[FIXED] When setting an explicit U value to any CP other than the last one of an open spline, the automatically generated U value of the last CP is wrong
				[FIXED] Invalid UV coordinates in some cases when using two different materials on closed splines
				[FIXED] Shape Extrusion module: UV coordinates of an extruded shape are wrong if you activate Hard Edges and Extended UV options while not providing any value for those options
				[API/CHANGE] MetaCGOptions.HasDifferentMaterial does not create anymore a MetaCGOptions instance at the previous CP if such instance does not exist
